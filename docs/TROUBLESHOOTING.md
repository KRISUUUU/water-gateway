# Troubleshooting

## No Frames Received

**Symptoms:** `frames_received` counter stays at 0, no messages on `rf/raw` topic.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **CC1101 not connected or SPI wiring wrong** — Check SPI connections (MOSI, MISO, SCK, CS, GDO0). Verify CC1101 responds by reading chip part number register (0x30 should return 0x00 for CC1101).
2. **Wrong frequency** — Default is 868.950 MHz (T-mode). Verify meters in range use this frequency. Some meters use C-mode or different T-mode variants.
3. **Antenna missing or poor** — CC1101 needs an appropriate 868 MHz antenna. A wire cut to ~86mm (quarter-wave) is a minimum.
4. **Radio in error state** — Check web panel RF Diagnostics page. If radio state is "error", check `fifo_overflows` and `radio_resets` counters.

## Long Frame / FIFO Drops

**Symptoms:** `frames_received` increases slowly while `frames_dropped_too_long` or
`frames_incomplete` counters rise.

**Possible Causes:**

1. Current polling RX path cannot safely drain all long frames without GDO-threshold interrupts.
2. Bursty RF traffic causing FIFO pressure and partial captures.
3. Incorrect CC1101 mode/config for local RF environment.

Use this as an RF validation signal, not as a UI/API bug. Full mitigation requires
hardware-validated interrupt-driven FIFO draining.

## Live Telegrams Shows Empty

**Symptoms:** Dashboard counters increase, but Live Telegrams page stays empty.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Wrong filter selected** — Switch filter to `all` (`watched`/`unknown`/`duplicates`/`crc_fail` can be empty).
2. **Session expired** — Refresh page and log in again.
3. **No recent traffic window** — List is a bounded recent cache and can be empty after reboot/start.

## Watchlist / Detected Meters Issues

**Symptoms:** Meter appears in telegrams but not as expected in watchlist UX.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Identity format mismatch** — Use exact key from Detected Meters page (`mfg:....-id:....` or `sig:...`).
2. **Watchlist disabled** — Entry exists but `enabled=false`.
3. **Identity fallback changed** — For undecodable frames fallback is signature-based and can differ with frame preamble/content.

## WiFi Connection Issues

**Symptoms:** Device fails to connect, frequent reconnects.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Wrong credentials** — Re-provision or update via serial console
2. **Weak signal** — Move device closer to AP, or check WiFi RSSI in telemetry
3. **AP compatibility** — ESP32 supports 2.4 GHz only (no 5 GHz)

## MQTT Connection Issues

**Symptoms:** `mqtt_state` shows "disconnected", `mqtt_reconnects` climbing.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Wrong broker address/port** — Verify config matches broker
2. **Authentication failure** — Verify MQTT username/password
3. **Broker unreachable** — Check network routing from device to broker
4. **Client ID conflict** — Two devices with same client ID cause disconnects

## Web Panel Not Loading

**Symptoms:** Browser shows connection refused or blank page.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Device not connected to WiFi** — Cannot reach device IP
2. **SPIFFS not flashed** — Web assets may not be on the flash partition; reflash
3. **Wrong IP/hostname** — Use `wmbus-gw.local` or check router for assigned IP
4. **Static path mismatch** — Check HTTP logs for:
   - requested URI
   - resolved file path
   - file open failure (`404`)

If needed, rebuild and flash full image (`idf.py build && idf.py -p <PORT> flash`) so
`storage.bin` is written with `index.html`, `app.js`, and `styles.css`.

## OTA Failed

**Symptoms:** OTA status shows "failed" or device doesn't boot new firmware.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Image too large** — Must be < 1.5 MB (partition size)
2. **Wrong image** — Must be built for this specific ESP32 partition layout
3. **Download interrupted** — URL OTA failed mid-download; retry
4. **Rollback occurred** — New firmware failed health check; device reverted
5. **Wrong upload content type** — `/api/ota/upload` expects binary body (`application/octet-stream`)
6. **OTA already running** — Endpoint returns conflict (`409`)

## Login Rate Limited

**Symptoms:** `POST /api/auth/login` returns `429 rate_limited`.

**Possible Causes:**

1. Too many failed logins in a short window (5 failures / 60 seconds).
2. Automation retry loop with wrong credentials.

Use `retry_after_s` from API response before next attempt.

## High Memory Usage

**Symptoms:** `free_heap_bytes` drops below 50KB, potential crashes.

**Possible Causes:**

1. **MQTT backlog** — If broker is unreachable, outbox may grow; bounded at 32 items
2. **Many concurrent HTTP requests** — Web panel open in multiple tabs
3. **Memory leak** — Check `min_free_heap_bytes` trend over time
